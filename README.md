What is vanilla JavaScript used for?
Vanilla JavaScript refers to using plain Javascript without any additional libraries or frameworks. 
The term became popular when Eric Wastl created the Vanilla JS site in 2012 as a joke. 
The site tries to bring attention to the fact that you can use just plain Javascript in many cases.
Redux Saga is a middleware library used to allow a Redux store to interact with resources outside of itself asynchronously. 
This includes making HTTP requests to external services, accessing browser storage, and executing I/O operations. 
These operations are also known as side effects
